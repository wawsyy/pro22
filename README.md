# Encrypted Household Debt Register

A privacy-preserving system for recording household debts (loans, credit cards, borrowing) using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) via the FHEVM protocol by Zama.

## Overview

This system allows users to:
- Record debt amounts and types without exposing sensitive financial information
- View encrypted debt records
- Decrypt and view their own debt status locally
- Track debt statistics by type (publicly, without revealing individual amounts)
- Add descriptions and priority levels to debt records
- Batch update multiple debt statuses
- Access emergency pause functionality for security
- View comprehensive user debt summaries

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 20 or higher
- **npm or yarn/pnpm**: Package manager

### Installation

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat vars set MNEMONIC

   # Set your Infura API key for network access
   npx hardhat vars set INFURA_API_KEY

   # Optional: Set Etherscan API key for contract verification
   npx hardhat vars set ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
   ```

3. **Compile and test**

   ```bash
   npm run compile
   npm run test
   ```

4. **Deploy to local network**

   ```bash
   # Start a local FHEVM-ready node
   npx hardhat node
   # Deploy to local network
   npx hardhat deploy --network localhost
   ```

5. **Deploy to Sepolia Testnet**

   ```bash
   # Deploy to Sepolia
   npx hardhat deploy --network sepolia
   # Verify contract on Etherscan
   npx hardhat verify --network sepolia <CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
   ```

6. **Test on Sepolia Testnet**

   ```bash
   # Once deployed, you can run a simple test on Sepolia.
   npx hardhat test --network sepolia
   ```

## 🔐 Debt Types

- `0`: Loan
- `1`: Credit Card
- `2`: Borrowing
- `3`: Other

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Privacy & Encryption
- **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**: All debt amounts and owner addresses are encrypted on-chain
- **Local Decryption**: Only users with the correct private key can decrypt their own data
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Transaction inputs are validated without revealing sensitive information

### Smart Contract Security
- **Access Control**: Only contract owners can perform emergency operations
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated before processing
- **Gas Optimization**: Efficient batch operations to reduce transaction costs
- **Emergency Pause**: Owner can pause contract functionality in case of issues

### Frontend Security
- **Wallet Integration**: Secure connection to user's Web3 wallet
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized and validated
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- **Network Validation**: Contract interactions validated against expected networks
